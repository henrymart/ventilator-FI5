to configure hl-core/cmsis it is mandatory to specifiy the used MPU (e.g., STM32F10X_MD)
as a preprocessor macro of the compiler (e.g., with -DSTM32F10X_MD).

it is also mandatory to copy inside the project one of the startup_xxxxx.s files and change
it according the needs (e.g., in heap and stack size).

moreover, it is possible to override two functions of the cmsis, SystemInit() and 
SystemCoreClockUpdate() to specify proper behaviours (e.g., different clocks or relocation
of vector table or execution from RAM etc.).

it is advised to defined those functions in a file named hl_cfg_cmsis_stm32fx_overridden.c
