/** @fn         extern void osal_system_start(void (*launcher_fn)(void))
    @brief      Start the scheduler which executes the function launcher_fn() inside the launcher task with priority 
                osal_prio_systsk_launcher (254). 
                The launcher_fn() function is responsible to start any other task and at the end it must either: 
                (a) call return which causes the system to stop the launcher task and releasing the launcher stack;
                or (b) adjust its priority to a value between osal_prio_usrtsk_min and osal_prio_usrtsk_max and run
                as a normal task. 
                At the end of the launcher_fn(), the system shall have the following tasks:
                (a) the scheduler with priority osal_prio_systsk_scheduler (255), (b) the idle task with priority
                osal_prio_systsk_idle (0), (c) the user-defined tasks with user priorities, and possibly (d) the launcher 
                task with user priority.
    @param      launcher_fn     Pointer to the launcher function. The function is responsible to init all required osal
                                data structures and to start tasks.  Finally it shall return or enter a forever loop.  
                                This function runs at highest priority in the system (osal_prio_systsk_launcher = 254) 
                                and allows other tasks to execute only when it returns or blocks itself in a forever loop 
                                or if its priority is lowered.
    @return     The function never returns. If launcher_fn is NULL it calls the error manager, otherwise it starts the 
                scheduler.
